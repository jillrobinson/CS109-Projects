    "# Brunching in Chicago\n",
    "Time Out Chicago (Amy Cavanaugh, 8th March 2016) published an [article](http://www.timeout.com/chicago/restaurants/20-best-brunch-spots-in-chicago) listing the 20 best brunch spots in Chicago. Yum! I want to see all the restaurant locations on a map and find the closest one to me that I haven't already visited. To do this, I needed to scrape the Time Out Chicago website for the restaurant names and locations, convert the addresses to lattitude and longitude co-ordinates for the calculation of distances and plotting on a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project is inspired by Lecture 2 (about data scraping) of Harvard's CS109 Data Science course and is adapted from a number of the examples in the relevant lecture notes, including the example taken from Katharine Jarmul's talk about data scraping at PyCon2014. I'm using this project to practice the skills taught in these lectures. \n",
